#### XSTEST: A Test Suite for Identifying Exaggerated Safety Behaviours in Large Language Models

<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01263.pdf">
<img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D22AQHL9eIg5TEFvg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1691223790525?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Wtr3y3gcczS4gGqiF7NjuqwumAXMUZWdxbxDVszwm1M" width="500" height="500" alt="Open AI: Content Moderator"></img>
</a>


**Main Highlight**:This paper introduces a test suite called XSTEST to identify exaggerated safety behaviors in large language models (LLMs), such as refusing safe requests due to misinterpretation as unsafe. 

Using XSTEST, the authors found that the Llama2 model exhibits substantial exaggerated safety behavior, refusin1g 38% of test prompts and partially refusing another 22%. 

The findings suggest that this behavior is a result of lexical overfitting, making models overly sensitive to certain words, and that OpenAI's GPT-4 is better calibrated in comparison.

**Main Highlight**: This repo introduces the content deformation field CoDeF, a new video representation comprising a canonical content field for static content and a temporal deformation field for transformations along time. 

The CoDeF system has been designed to lift image algorithms for video processing, enabling image-to-image translation to be adapted for video-to-video translation and keypoint detection for keypoint tracking without training. This approach provides superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos and can track non-rigid objects like water and smog.
