#### MIT News: [AI model can help determine where a patient’s cancer arose](https://news.mit.edu/2023/ai-model-can-help-determine-where-patients-cancer-arose-0807)


Researchers at MIT and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed a machine-learning model called OncoNPC that analyzes the genetic sequence of 400 genes to predict the origin of a tumor in the body. This approach can accurately classify at least 40% of previously unidentifiable tumors, enabling a 2.2-fold increase in patients eligible for targeted treatment. The model has the potential to guide doctors towards personalized treatments, and the team plans to expand the model to include other data types for a more comprehensive prediction.

**Key Takeaway**:
The OncoNPC model can significantly improve treatment options for patients with cancers of unknown primary origin, enabling more precise and effective therapies. By guiding treatment decisions, it may enhance survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients. The model's development marks a promising step towards integrating AI in medical diagnostics and patient care, setting a precedent for future advancements in personalized medicine.

#### Google: [AdaTape: Foundation model with adaptive computation and dynamic read-and-write](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/08/adatape-foundation-model-with-adaptive.html)

Research Summary:

Adaptive computation is about a machine learning system adjusting its behavior based on the complexity of the input, rather than using a fixed function like conventional neural networks. AdaTape is a new model that takes this to the next level by using dynamic sets of tokens to create elastic input sequences. It offers better performance in various tasks, and more efficiency compared to other adaptive models. Its innovative approaches, such as an adaptive tape reading mechanism and a unique "tape bank," make it a promising breakthrough in the field.

Potential Impact:

- Enhanced Efficiency: By tailoring computation based on input complexity, AdaTape can allocate resources more judiciously, improving the performance-to-cost ratio. This could result in significant savings in processing time and computational resources.

- Increased Accuracy: AdaTape offers the ability to dynamically adjust its approach to processing data. This adaptability allows it to outperform conventional and existing adaptive models in specific challenging tasks, such as image classification and algorithmic tasks.

- New Solutions to Old Problems: AdaTape's inductive bias makes it capable of solving problems that were previously out of reach for other models. For example, it successfully tackled the parity task, a problem that standard transformers could not solve.

- Wider Application Scope: With its flexibility and efficiency, AdaTape could be implemented across a range of applications, from complex data analysis to real-time adaptive systems, making it a versatile tool for different industry needs.

- Alignment with Hardware: Unlike some adaptive models, AdaTape's architecture is well-suited to current hardware accelerators like TPUs. This compatibility ensures that businesses can harness its full potential without major hardware investments.

**Key Takeaway**:
As industries move towards more real-time and complex decision-making, the need for adaptive, efficient, and intelligent machine learning models grows. AdaTape answers this call by providing a mechanism that is not only more adaptable to varying complexities but also optimizes the tradeoff between quality and cost. By leveraging AdaTape, businesses can achieve higher accuracy, greater efficiency, and more innovative solutions, aligning with the ever-growing demands of the digital age. This makes AdaTape a valuable asset in maintaining a competitive edge in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape.

#### AWS: [Amazon Translate enhances its custom terminology to improve translation accuracy and fluency](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-translate-enhances-its-custom-terminology-to-improve-translation-accuracy-and-fluency/)

Amazon Translate's neural machine translation service has introduced enhancements to its custom terminology, focusing on domain-specific and language-specific customizable translations. These updates allow for context-sensitive match and replace, preserving sentence constructs, and improving translation quality and fluency.

The new enhancements cater to government and commercial organizations, providing flexibility in translating unique content such as brand names, model names, and character names. The system recognizes context, gender, plurality, verb tense, and noun forms to create more nuanced translations.

Examples include translating "tutor" with gender specificity in French, inflecting plurality for the word "sheep," or using the correct verb tense for "walking."

The update requires no changes for existing customers, and detailed instructions for creating and using custom terminology files are provided.

**Key Takeaway**
From a business perspective, this precision ensures that translations resonate more accurately with specific audiences, enhancing global communication and reducing the risk of misunderstandings. This can lead to more effective marketing, international relations, and customer service, ultimately having a positive impact on the bottom line.
