### Research Papers


#### Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings: Lucene Is All You Need

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14963">
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1365352170267299840/IzvjKckL_400x400.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Open AI: Content Moderator"></img>
</a>



**Main Highlight:** The paper challenges the prevailing notion that a specialized vector store is essential for leveraging deep neural networks in search applications. Using Lucene's Hierarchical Navigable Small-World (HNSW) indexes, the authors demonstrate that existing search infrastructure can efficiently handle vector search with OpenAI embeddings. This suggests that adding a dedicated vector store to an already complex AI stack may not offer a justified cost-benefit advantage.
