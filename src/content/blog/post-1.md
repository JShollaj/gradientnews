As you have probably realized by now, our newsfeed and social media is build on shaky foundations. 

Every day we are  overwhelmed by clickbait headliners, content without any substance or with an obvious agenda behind.
TikTok and YouTube shorts are overtaking social media. Most users usually jump to conclusions without reading a full
article or verifying the sources  - but instead they choose to rely on their feelings and emotions while mindlessly scrolling.

As studies conducted by [Berger & Milkman](https://consumerresearcher.com/jonah-berger-contagious) explain, extreme emotional triggers (whether anxiety or excitement) tend to extract more engagement from users. Most social media platforms are usually build on top of algorithms which dont necessarily punish negative content, but instead increase the likelihood it will be recommended to other users, therefore gain more exposure [as a study from Mozilla shows](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/youtube/user-controls/).

Therefore, its not surprising to see an increase in either [**overhyped**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs) or [**doomsday scenarios**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW2ihBRzLxc&t=172s) for Generative AI. No better advertisement for your next book, course or product than selling desperation, anxiety or hope.
